// this component will be conditionally rendered

// add reactstrap badge to display how many items are in cart, if any (if 0: no badge)

// conditionally render cart's own dropdown menu (same format as profile), which displays a mini view of items in cart
// (fetch needed?)

// useEffect which watches cart items triggers this Popover; does not disappear with timeout
