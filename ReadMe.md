## Some techy things I like:
- Custom-built backend with ASP.NET Core MVC controllers for API endpoints, securely connected to a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- UI login functionality integrated via ASP.NET Core Identity, with different views and privileges available depending on the logged-in user's role
- Full CRUD operations on multiple fronts: customer users can customize and place orders, admin users can manage orders and inventory
- Development managed using agile methodology; created an ERD, wireframe, and user stories; planned sprints; managed tasks via GitHub Issue Tracker & Projects tool
- A well-thought-through UI and vibe: friendly for multiple viewports; custom graphic design and branding
